		<h1>Weblog Browser Demo</h1>

		This is just a demo of the Weblog Browser widget.
		To get a copy for your website, just <a href="/">find your station on the map</a> - the code you need is on the page for your station.<br>
		<br>
		<script src="/widget/?ids=1,5" type="text/javascript"></script>
		<br>
		When you click on the icon above, a pop-up menu should appear.
		If you're using an older browser, it will just take you to the london bloggers homepage.<br>
		<br>
		To show multiple stations in your weblog browser, change the "ids=5" part of the code
		into "ids=5,12" where 5 and 12 are the station IDs (you can find these out by looking 
		at the weblog browser code on each station's page). You can add as many station IDs as you 
		like, seperated by commas (e.g. "ids=1,2,3,4,5,6").<br>
		<br>
		To use the mini version of the browser, add <code>&amp;mini=1</code> after the station ids.
		The mini version looks like this:<br>
		<br>
		<script src="/widget/?ids=3,4&mini=1" type="text/javascript"></script>
